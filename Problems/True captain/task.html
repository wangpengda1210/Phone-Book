<h2>True captain</h2>

  <p><em>“The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. Do you understand?” – Jack Sparrow</em></p> 
  <p>This code prints the name of current captain (now it is Hector's name). </p> 
  <p>However, the crew re-elected the captain, and now it's Jack Sparrow.</p> 
  <p>Fix the declaration of <code class="java">captain</code> variable and redirect it from Hector Barbossa to Jack Sparrow by creating a new <code class="java">Pirate</code> object by analogy. After that print the name of current captain again.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p> 
  <p>Hector Barbossa</p> 
  <p>Jack Sparrow</p>
